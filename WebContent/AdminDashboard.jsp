        	<h1>About-Us</h1>
            <p>The Hotel Management System is a Java full-stack project
            designed by Harshal Borase. This web-based application is crafted to
            streamline hotel operations and enhance customer experience. It is
            built using technologies like Java, JSP, Servlets, and a relational
            database such as MySQL, ensuring efficient management of key
            functionalities such as room reservations, customer
            check-in/check-out, staff management. The
            front-end integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a
            user-friendly interface, while the back-end focuses on secure data
            handling and smooth workflow automation. This project showcases
            Harshal Borase's expertise in full-stack development, offering a
            robust and scalable solution for modern hotel management.
